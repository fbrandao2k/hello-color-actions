# Hello world javascript Github action

## Github workflow action
This code is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration for building, testing, and deploying a website to an AWS S3 bucket. Here’s a summary:

Workflow Trigger: Runs on a push to the repository.

Build Job:

Runs on the latest Ubuntu environment.
Uses Node.js version 20.x to install dependencies, build the project, and run tests.
The CI environment variable is set to true for npm test to ensure tests behave correctly in the continuous integration environment.
Deploy Job:

Depends on the successful completion of the build job.
Checks out the latest code and syncs the build output to an AWS S3 bucket using the jakejarvis/s3-sync-action.
Environment variables for the AWS S3 bucket name, access key, and secret access key are stored in GitHub Secrets for secure access. The files are set to public read access and sync options include deleting removed files.
This workflow automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a website to S3 after each push.


## Jest Testing

This code is a test script using Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. Let’s break down what each part does:

Code Explanation
const hello = require("./hello");
This line imports the hello module from a file named hello.js located in the same directory as this test script. The require function is used to load modules in Node.js.

describe("My hello", () => { ... });
The describe function is used in Jest to group related tests. Here, "My hello" is the name of the test suite (a logical grouping of related tests). The second parameter is a function that contains the tests you want to run.

test("works", () => { ... });
Inside the describe block, test is used to define an individual test case. "works" is the name of the test, which will be displayed in the test output. The second parameter is a function that defines the specific behavior being tested.

expect(hello.hello()).toEqual("Hello World from the Office Hours in the terminal!");
This line is the actual test assertion. Here’s what each part does:

hello.hello() calls the hello function from the imported hello module.
expect(...).toEqual(...) is an assertion that checks if the value returned by hello.hello() is equal to "Hello World from the Office Hours in the terminal!". If the values are equal, the test passes; if not, it fails.
How It Works
When Jest runs this test:

It loads the hello module.
It then calls hello.hello() and checks that it returns "Hello World from the Office Hours in the terminal!".
If the actual output matches the expected output, the test passes. Otherwise, it fails, and Jest will indicate the mismatch.
This setup is useful for verifying that the hello module's function is returning the expected output.
